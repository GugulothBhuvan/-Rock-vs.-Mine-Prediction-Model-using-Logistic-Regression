# Rock vs. Mine Prediction Model

## Introduction:

This repository contains a logistic regression model for predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine based on certain features. The goal of the model is to perform binary classification tasks, particularly in scenarios where distinguishing between rocks and mines is important.

## Dependencies:

This project requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage:

To use the model, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Run the main script or notebook.
4. Input the relevant data separated by commas when prompted.
5. Interpret the prediction result (Rock or Mine).

## Model Training:

The model was trained using logistic regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks. Data preprocessing steps may include feature scaling or normalization. Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall were used to assess its performance.

## Dataset:

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of features related to objects, possibly including sonar signals or physical characteristics, along with corresponding labels indicating whether each object is a rock or a mine. It's recommended to provide citation or source information for the dataset used.
This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle( a free open source platform for data sources)
## File Structure:

- `main.py` or `main.ipynb`: Main code file for running the model.
- `data/`: Directory containing dataset files.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the project.
- Additional scripts or notebooks (if any).

## Future Improvements:

Potential improvements for the project include experimenting with different algorithms (e.g., neural networks), exploring feature engineering techniques, or optimizing model hyperparameters for better performance.
